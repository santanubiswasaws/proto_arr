# ARR Analysis 


This is a Python application that enables you to load a CSV file containing SaaS contract data and generate Recurring Revenue Analysis.Users can also interact with the analysis models, make modifications and run what-if analysis. In addition the application leverages Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses to user queries about the Recurring Revenue Data.
